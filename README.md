# Python Koch Program
## Description
This program takes an integer value and draws a koch triangle with that many iterations. Due to the limitations of python and the turtle library, it can only do about 8 iterations before it starts slowing down considerably. It was created by Malachi English February 2023 for 12 Mathematics Extension 2 assignment 1. 

## Running
To run the program, open the 'dist' file, and run the 'koch.exe' executable. 'Koch.py' may also be run directly if python is installed, and the modules used in the program are also installed.
